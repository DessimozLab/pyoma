Inference pipeline of OMA
=========================

This part of the library is stored in the inference subpackage. you need to import it with

.. code-block:: python

    import pyoma.inference

The inference part is not yet completed! There is essentially just a bit of code to
access pairwise relations from a hdf5 file and modify certain flags efficiently.
Most likely you don't want to work with this code yet!
